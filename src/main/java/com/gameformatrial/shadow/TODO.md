## **refined progress Ideas**
**Idee 1: You need to collect ore. After that you find a warden to kill you, but before you killed you drop a slime ore. 
    there is a change the failer or succeed. You respawn and get shadow powers. You get small powers. With that power develop you more powers and become stronger.
    After that find more ore to develop you powers, and make you stronger. if you die you lose some power.** Favorite from me

Idee 2: You need to collect ore. After that you need make the ore radioactive. To make it radioactive you need to find a slimeball and combined with the shadow ore.
        Then you need to go mix it with the warden drop. to create shadow slime. with that shadow slime you get powers. 

Idee 3: You need to collect ore. After that you need to use it on a creeper. and make the creeper to explode by a warden. to get Shadow slime. You don't die by creeper explosion,
        but rest die or break.
